## 
The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. 

The dashboard provides for a volunteer to filter demographic data based on test subject ID no.
Once the test subject ID no. is selected from the drop down menu, the charts will update to
reflect data specific to that ID no. The user is able to hover over the bar and bubble chart for
additional information.
